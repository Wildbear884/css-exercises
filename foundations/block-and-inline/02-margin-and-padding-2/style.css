Overall I think that it went pretty well. Now to check the solution
and see how off I am.

Well I think I did pretty well. 
But instead of selecting both the div element and the h1 element they put 
margin-bottom on the .title and the .content.

I think they did that so that it is more specific than just selecting all
divs and h1 elements. So I think that the way they did it makes more sense
overall then the way I did it. But as what I have works I will leave it
be. But for future reference I will do what they did.
